# Symfony PSR-2 CodeSniffer ruleset <img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/xalopp/symfony-coding-standard.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status" style="max-width:100%;">

Provides a Symfony PSR CodeSniffer ruleset

* PSR-1 & PSR-2
* Symfony standard
* Symfony naming conventions

Strongly inspired by the [OpenSky Symfony2 coding standard](https://github.com/opensky/Symfony2-coding-standard) (forked InterfaceSuffixSniff).
Yet, this ruleset relies on CodeSniffer PSR-1 & 2 sniffs and adds Symfony standards & naming conventions. It also allows chained calls (fluent interface).

## Installation

1. Install phpcs:

        pear install PHP_CodeSniffer

2. Find your PEAR directory:

        pear config-show | grep php_dir

3. Copy, symlink or check out this repo to a folder called Symfony inside the
   phpcs `Standards` directory:

        cd /path/to/pear/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards
        git clone git://github.com/xalopp/symfony-coding-standard.git Symfony

4. Select the Symfony ruleset as your default coding standard:

        phpcs --config-set default_standard Symfony

5. Profit

        phpcs path/to/my/file.php


## Pragmatic & opinionated customisations

### Allows fluent-interface chained calls syntax

```php
<?php

    $this
        ->getFoo()
            ->getBar()
            ->getBar()
    ; // This is allowed

    $this->getFoo()  ; // This is a violation

?>
```

## Known limitations

* functions aren't enforced at the moment

## Contributing

If you do contribute code to these sniffs, please make sure it conforms to the PEAR coding standard and that the unit tests still pass.

To check the coding standard, run from the Symfony-coding-standard source root:

        phpcs --ignore=Tests --standard=PEAR . -n

The unit-tests are run from within the PHP_CodeSniffer directory

* get the [CodeSniffer repository](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
* symlink, copy or clone this repository at CodeSniffer/Standard/Symfony
* from the CodeSniffer repository root run `phpunit --filter Symfony_ tests/AllTests.php`

## Issue

If you spot any missing standard/conventions and don't want to contribute, please open an issue. It will at least be added to this readme.
